    title: 'Untangling a Stalled Analytics Project',
    icon: '/switchyardtransparent.png',
    challenge: 'A mid-sized business had a critical analytics initiative stall due to unclear goals, stakeholder misalignment, and team frustration. Progress was an insurmountable chore.',
    approach: 'We brought it down to the foundation to redefine the project\'s core objective. Building on that we got stakeholders aligned, and mapped out a clear, step-by-step plan.',
    result: 'The project was back on track in weeks, not months. I delivered its first win in over a yaer within the quarter, delivered actionable results, and improved decision-making across departments.',

    title: 'Automating Manual Reporting',
    icon: '/switchyardtransparent.png',
    challenge: 'Teams were spending 10+ hours each week on repetitive data pulls and manual reporting. Data was frequently late or inaccurate, leading to distrust in the data.',
    approach: 'We quickly identified the most time-consuming manual workflows and replaced them with MVP products. We continued to design and implement fully automated data pipelines and reporting dashboards.',
    result: 'Each improvement freed up staff to build upon itself. The project accellerated exponentially and data generation time dropped by 80%, freeing up staff for higher-value analysis and strategy.',

    title: 'Scaling Data Infrastructure',
    icon: '/switchyardtransparent.png',
    challenge: 'Rapid growth was straining a company\'s data systems, causing slow performance, data quality issues, and a lack of trust in the numbers.',
    approach: 'After a full audit, we rebuilt the platform for scale and reliability. Designing with clean data first, we rolled over to a new modern architecture.',
    result: 'The business now operates with a single source of truth, making faster, data-driven decisions with confidence as it continues to grow.',
